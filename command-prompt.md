# Command Prompt

Command Prompt is a command line interpreter application available in Windows operating systems. It allows you to type commands that you want to execute, and then the Command Prompt program will carry out those commands for you.

To open Command Prompt, you can type "command prompt" into the search bar on your Start menu and click the "Command Prompt" result that appears. Alternatively, you can press the Windows key + R on your keyboard, type "cmd" into the Run dialog that appears, and press Enter.

Once you have the Command Prompt open, you can type in commands and press Enter to execute them. Some common commands include:
