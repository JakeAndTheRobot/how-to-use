# Command Prompt

Command Prompt is a command line interpreter application available in Windows operating systems. It allows you to type commands that you want to execute, and then the Command Prompt program will carry out those commands for you.

To open Command Prompt, you can type "command prompt" into the search bar on your Start menu and click the "Command Prompt" result that appears. Alternatively, you can press the Windows key + R on your keyboard, type "cmd" into the Run dialog that appears, and press Enter.

Once you have the Command Prompt open, you can type in commands and press Enter to execute them. Some common commands include:

"dir" - this lists the files and directories in the current directory
"cd" - this allows you to change the current directory
"type" - this allows you to view the contents of a text file
"copy" - this allows you to copy files
"del" - this allows you to delete files
There are many more commands available in Command Prompt, and you can find out more about them by typing "help" into the Command Prompt window and pressing Enter. You can also find many resources online that can provide more information about using Command Prompt.
